# Summary 
This calculator allows you to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. I used tkinter for GUI to see / have the actual calculator look.  
### Example:

### Additional Information
I added percentage and . symbol to complete my calculator template. Also, i researched about GUI and tkinter that's why my output ends up with this look.
